find ecentricity by equation based periapsis and apoapsis,
semilatus rectum l = a*1-eccentricity^2
excentricity = mean of apoapsis and periapsis = (apoapsis - periapsis) / 2(length of the semi major axis)
^gives you the eccentricity

distance from sun to planet = semilatus rectum / 1 + eccentricity*cos(theta)
^equation to graph a elipse (what an orbit is)

What you need for this to work:
apoapsis And periapsis
- we can achieve this by manual input or by desiganting both the apoapsis and periapsis in a  button like (small, medium, large)\
	- either works
the second equation gives you the distance from the star to the planet, will give a common elipse based on the ratio, so only mark where the periapsis and apoapsis are if you can

coordinates 0,0 are your star
